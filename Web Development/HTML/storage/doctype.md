`<!doctype html>`: The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. Doctypes used to look something like this:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
```

More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to work right. `<!doctype html>` is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype.
