## Characteristics of POST Requests
1. The request body contains the data being sent to the server. Data is not appended to the URL (as with GET request).
2. Post requests are not cached by browsers or servers.
3. Post requests are not idempotent.
4. Data in the body allows for sending large payloads, avoiding the URL length limitations of GET.

## Anatomy of a POST Request
```plaintext
POST /books HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 51

{
  "title": "The Great Gatsby",
  "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald"
}
```

## Response from POST Request
A POST request should return a response indicating the outcome of the operation:
- **201 Created**: Indicates that the resource was successfully created.
- **202 Accepted**: Indicates the request has been accepted for processing (asynchronous operations).
- **400 Bad Request**: Indicates that the client sent invalid data.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Indicates a server error while processing the request.
