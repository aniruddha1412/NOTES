## Syntax
```html
<input type='password'>
```

- The only major difference between `type='password'` and `type='text'` is that the input value in `type='password'` is visually obscured (e.g., as dots or asterisks) to protect sensitive data like passwords.
- Rest it works mostly like `type='text'` and also has the same attributes.
