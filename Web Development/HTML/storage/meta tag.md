### Adding an Author and Description
Many `<meta>` elements include `name` and `content` attributes:

- `name` specifies the type of meta element it is; what type of information it contains.
- `content` specifies the actual meta content.

Two such meta elements that are useful to include on your page define the author of the page, and provide a concise description of the page. Let's look at an example:

```html
<meta name="author" content="Chris Mills" />
<meta
  name="description"
  content="The MDN Web Docs Learning Area aims to provide
complete beginners to the Web with all they need to know to get
started with developing websites and applications." />
```

Specifying an author is beneficial in many ways: it is useful to be able to understand who wrote the page, if you have any questions about the content and you would like to contact them. Some content management systems have facilities to automatically extract page author information and make it available for such purposes.

Specifying a description that includes keywords relating to the content of your page is useful as it has the potential to make your page appear higher in relevant searches performed in search engines (such activities are termed [Search Engine Optimization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO), or [SEO](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO).)
