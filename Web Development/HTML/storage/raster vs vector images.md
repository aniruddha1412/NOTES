On the web, you'll work with two types of images.

## Raster Images
- Raster images are defined using a grid of pixels.
- A raster image file contains information showing exactly where each pixel is to be placed,, and exactly what color it should be.
- Popular web raster formats include:
	- Bitmap (`.bmp`)
	- Portable Network Graphics (`.png`)
	- JPEG (`.jpg`)
	- Graphics Interchange Format (`.gif`)
***
## Vector Images
- Vector images are defined using algorithms.
- A vector image file contains shape and path definitions that the computer can use to work out what the image should look like when rendered on the screen.
- Example Format:
	- Scalable Vector Graphics (`.svg`)
***
## Apparent Difference between the Two
- When you zoom a Raster image, you'll be able to see pixelated image and the image will look blocky.
- When you zoom a Vector image, it will have the same clear and crisp look, no matter what size it is scaled to.
